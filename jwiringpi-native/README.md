# jwiringpi-native
## Description
The .h file is the header file of native methods (or called them functions in C) generated by javah command.
The .c file is the implements of the native methods in JWiringPiInterfaceImpl.java.
The libc4jwiringpi.so is the dynamic library referenced by jwiringpi Java class library, and the .so file is generated by the .c and .h file.

## How to use
If you just want to use wiringPi library in Java environments, you can just simply copy the file libc4jwiringpi.so to the system library path.<br />
        `sudo cp libc4jwiringpi.so /usr/lib`

You can also compiled the native functions with:<br />
        `gcc -shared -I ${JAVA_HOME}/include -I ${JAVA_HOME}/include/linux  jwiringpi_JWiringPiInterfaceImpl.c -lwiringPi -lwiringPiDev -o libc4jwiringpi.so -Wall
`


And then cp libc4jwiringpi.so to the system library path.
*   Note: if you don't want to copy the library to the /usr/lib, you can specify the library path before running your Java program, like:
         `java -Djava.library.path=. YouProgram`
         (this specify the . directory as the native library path.)
